## Fix
### Correct linguistic errors
Correcting linguistic errors during the output process.

### Show logs in descending order
Now when you display the logs using `lenght` they will display as descending order. Example: 
```sh
$ xpm lm show -l 4
```

## New
### Exit code
Now every error has its own exit code.

### Password generate without length
Now you can use password manager generate command without setting the length of the password. Example:
```sh
$ xpm pm g
```
This will genearte password with random length between 32 to 72.
